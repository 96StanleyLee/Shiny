# Welcome to Shiny

Shiny is an idea that's currently being brought to life by Rock Vincent Guitard and Stanley Lee.![Shiny](https://i.imgur.com/pdfzbKf.png)
It's a web-app built in React using a Ruby on Rails Backend with the vision of connecting ideas with the right team!

# Description


Shiny was created with a vision of creating a community where ideas can come alive. 

 - Users can submit ideas along with a description and several tags. 
 - Users can search up ideas through categories or tags. 
 - Users can volunteer to join a team of collaboraters based on idea needs (ie. Graphic Designer, Web Developer, Social Media Influencer)
 


## WIP
Currently Shiny is on hiatus. It was intended to be a side project for both Rock and I, but due to work place responsibilities it was put on hold.

Currently the features to be added :
- Idea Creation 
- Idea lookup through name
- Idea lookup through category
- Idea lookup through tags
- Collaboration page 

The current features added are :
- Auth through Rails (Might move to OAuth)
- Homepage 
- Multiple component designs ( Idea cards, page templates, modal designs)
